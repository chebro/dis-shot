DIS-SHOT
========

upload screenshots to discord with a keybind. depends on discord.js for all things discord related. uses maim (xorg screenshot tool) for taking screenshots.


INSTRUCTIONS
============

create a file named shot.png in the root dir. the program watches this file and uploads it to discord when the file is modified.

config.json specifies the channel to upload images to.

screenshot.sh takes a new screenshot and saves it to shot.png. this script should ideally bind to some keyboard shortcut.
